# SketchifyAI

## Overview
Welcome to SketchifyAI, where imagination meets the canvas of machine learning. This project is an exploration into the world of artificial intelligence, enabling the transformation of textual descriptions into exquisite pencil sketches. Dive into the synergy of words and art, as we bring to life the simplicity of objects like 'apple', 'banana', and beyond.

## Features
- **Text-to-Sketch Conversion**: Input a word, get a sketch.
- **Machine Learning at its Core**: Built with Python using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for easy interaction.
